## PixelChess

Simple chess project done as first program made in C# to gain some experience in the language.
Goal is to just make interactive graphical game application using MonoGame framework without any complex ui.

In close future game will be probably connected to, written by me, chess engine. Actually only human player enemy is possible.

### Main features to come:

    - position editing tool
    - fen based layout input
    - integration with own chess ai bot
    - possibly remote games
